The math scripts will display simple arithmatic problems for the user to
answer. The user will get one or two chances to answer correctly, depending
on the difficulty level of the problem. 

The problems will be grouped according to the following:

Addition / subtraction (always larger from smaller)
	1 digit numbers (0-9)
	2 digit numbers (0-99)
Multiplication
	1 digit numbers (0-9)
	2 digit numbers (0-20 or 2-20?)
Division (generate random divisor and answer, multiply to get numerator)
	The divisor and answers are a 1 digit number (1-9)
	The divisor is 1 digit (1-9), and the result is 2 digits (10-20?)
Exponents/Roots
	Squares of 1-20
	Cubes of 1-10
	Powers of 2 (1-10)
